# Polyhedron Engine(Q2RTX Fork) - Folder: basenac/materials


## Description:
This folder operates for now just like in Quake 2 RTX. mapname.mat prioritizes over other .mat file contents. Other than that they get loaded in alphabetical order so it is wise to not try and setup a material in 2 files: > This is currently simply just not supported.
