# Polyhedron Engine(Q2RTX Fork) - Folder: art_source

## Description:
Art Source work that may need to be re-accessed later, can be stored here. Keep in mind it is likely not going to play kind on huge ass blender files of 45mb and up.

We might have to use SVN or some other method sometime in the future, but I think that for now this will do.

As of right now, it only contains the source files to the Polyhedron logo.
