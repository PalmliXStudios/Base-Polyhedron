# Polyhedron Engine(Q2RTX Fork) - Folder: basenac/maps

## Description:
Contains all the final end-result .bsp files. The two subfolders are never part of a release:

>* prefabmaps : Contains all sorts of unique prefabs, however we don't consider that to be part of our problem.
>* srcmaps : Contains all source files of the maps. Make sure please, that they align with the latest compiled version of your map. We don't want to get a mess out here.
