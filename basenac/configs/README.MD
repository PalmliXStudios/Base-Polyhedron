# Polyhedron Engine(Q2RTX Fork) - Folder: basenac/configs

## Description:
Configuration files that are written by the client, server or perhaps seveal for ourselves that setup certain debug data. As such I can already imagine there being one or two for booting the game with certain cvars set to see how a map or a mesh renders, etc.
